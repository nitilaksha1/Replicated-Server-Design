Design Choices-

LAMPORT CLOCK MANAGEMENT:
---------------------------

* Make a class for Lamport Clock management as follows:
1. Create a class named "LamportClock"<br />
2. Create a data member "int clockvalue"<br />
3. Create methods the following methods: 
	* void UpdateClockForSendRequest (void)
	* void UpdateClockForReceiveRequest (TimeStamp message)
	* int  getClockValue()

TOTAL ORDERING MANAGEMENT:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Since we are not constructing stream objects we need to somehow find a way to send timestamp of sender process in the request. 
	* For this we can add a timestamp parameter to all requests in the service file.
	* Since client is not required to send this timestamp we can assume that a zero value in time stamp indicates that the request is from a client and not from another server.
* Since the lamport clock value is unique for every event keep a track of the number of acknowledgments received for each request.<br />
1. Maintain a hashmap with key as the Lamport clock value of the time of request creation and value of count of acknowledgements received<br />
2. *We will have to create a new methods which define the acknowledgements received for various requests in the server.<br />
